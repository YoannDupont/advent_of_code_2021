# Ada Advent of Code 2021

Ada solutions to Advent of Code 2021. I may not be able to publish solutions
daily, but they will come sooner or later.

Trying to use a couple Ada 202X constructs, at least those currently available,
thinking mainly about `@`.

# Build

You can build the project using the command:

`gnat make -Paoc2021.gpr`

# Run

Executables are in the `exec` folder. They always take 1 argument: the path to
the input puzzle.

If you want to run day 1, use the command:

`path/to/advent_of_code_2020/exec/day01 /path/to/input.txt`
